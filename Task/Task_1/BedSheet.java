		System.out.println("\nRead the fiber content first.\n100% cotton is always an excellent go-to because it's soft and affordable. If you're looking for premium, Extra-Long Staple (ELS) cotton, like Egyptian or Pima, is even softer and more durable. \n");
		System.out.println("Thread count isn't everything.\nManufacturing techniques can allow brands to make high thread counts without actually increasing quality. Our tests have shown that 300 to 500 is a sweet spot for softness and strength. You can find good 200-thread-count sheets, but they may not be as comfy, and anything over 500 isn't necessarily better.\n");
		System.out.println("Know the difference between weaves.\nYour primary options are percale or sateen. Percale is a basic, grid-like weave that feels light and crisp. Sateen in a satin weave and feels silky smooth. It's a matter of personal preference, though in our tests, consumers tend to favor sateen.\n");
		System.out.println("Don't assume it'll fit your mattress.\nStandard sizes, like queen or king, don't account for mattress depth. So if yours is tall or if you use a mattress topper, make sure to measure before you buy. You should also account for some shrinkage after laundering. Generally, fitted sheets that fit up to 15-inch mattresses have performed well in our fit tests.\n");
		System.out.println("Always check the return policy.\nIt's not easy knowing whether you'll love sleeping on the sheets until you've tried them out. Some brands, especially those that have internet-only sales, allow you to make returns for any reason, even up to a few months after the purchase.\n");
