		System.out.println("Movement:\nThe movement inside the watch is an important factor. For example, Grand Seiko uses a standard inspection procedure to test the mechanical movements of their watches before they are cased.\n");
		System.out.println("Accuracy:\nSome watches are known for their accuracy, such as Omega watches, which are accurate to within -1/+5, surpassing the standard set by the Official Swiss Chronometer Testing Institute (COSC) of about -4/+6. \n");
		System.out.println("Richard Mille Certificate:\nRichard Mille introduced the RM 031 High Performance Certificate in 2012 for the RM 031 High Performance watch. In order to receive this guarantee of quality, the watch must have a rate deviation of less than 30 seconds a month, or one second/day. \n");
		System.out.println("The Wristwatch\nIf you want to be academic about it, the watch is something of an engineering marvel. Watches have hundreds of minuscule parts, meticulously assembled by artisans who can trace their craft back to the watchmakers under Elizabeth, Peter, and Napoleon. Before the Great War, these artisans were focused on making pocket watches, a true gentlemanâ€™s accessory.\n");
